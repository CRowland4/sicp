This repo contains my notes and solutions to problems as I go through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Second Edition.

There is one directory for each chapter. Within these directories are two types of files, exercise files and code follow along files. The code follow along files are simply me writing out the code in the book in order to get a better understanding of it. The exercise files contain my (sometimes rough) solutions to each exercise.

Both of the two types mentioned above were created on a first pass of the book. I would like to do a second pass at some point, where I'm focused less on the granularity of implementation details and more on getting the systems discussed in the book to work as a whole.

As I got deeper into my first pass (beginning of chapter 3 as I write this), it became clear that having a full working system as you go is much more inline with the style of the book than focusing on each piece individually. These are things you seemingly learn after they would have initially been useful, but repetition is a key to retention, so the desire to go back over the chapters at some point in the future produced by this late discovery actually make it a net positive.

This note is aimed at my future self so I can refresh myself on the purpose of a second pass.
